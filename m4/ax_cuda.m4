# Check for an OpenCL implementation. If CL is found, _OPENCL is defined and
# the required compiler and linker flags are included in the output variables
# "CL_CFLAGS" and "CL_LIBS", respectively. If no usable CL implementation is
# found, "no_cl" is set to "yes".
#
# If the header "CL/OpenCL.h" is found, "HAVE_CL_OPENCL_H" is defined. If the
# header "OpenCL/OpenCL.h" is found, HAVE_OPENCL_OPENCL_H is defined. These
# preprocessor definitions may not be mutually exclusive.
